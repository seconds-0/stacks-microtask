- `get-task`: Retrieve information about a specific task

### Data Structure:

Tasks are stored with the following properties:
- `description`: Task description (string-utf8 256)
- `reward`: STX reward amount (uint)
- `poster`: Address of the task creator (principal)
- `claimer`: Address of the claimer, if claimed (optional principal)
- `status`: Current task status ("open", "claimed", or "completed")

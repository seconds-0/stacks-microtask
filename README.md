## Smart Contract

The Micro-Task Board is powered by the `microtasks-minimal` Clarity smart contract deployed on the Stacks testnet at:

```
ST29ZH6JAYVPQT1BRRFZ3K0EJCT0W50Q5E309N45A.microtasks-minimal
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- NPM (v7 or higher) 
- Clarinet (for Clarity contract development)
- A [Hiro Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) for testing

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stacks-microtask.git
   cd stacks-microtask
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Testnet Deployment

### 1. Configure Testnet Settings

The project includes a Testnet configuration in `settings/Testnet.toml`. Before deploying, update with your deployment wallet's mnemonic:

```toml
[network]
name = "testnet"
deployment_fee_rate = 10

[accounts.deployer]
mnemonic = "your-testnet-mnemonic-here"
balance = 1000000000000 # 1000 STX in microSTX
```

### 2. Fund Your Account

Visit the [Stacks testnet faucet](https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet) and request STX tokens for your testnet address.

### 3. Deploy the Smart Contract

```bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

After deployment, note your contract's address and update the `contractAddress` in `index.html` with your deployed contract address.

## Smart Contract Details

The Stacks Micro-Task Board uses a Clarity smart contract with the following main functions:

- `post-task`: Create a new task with a description and STX reward
- `claim-task`: Claim an available task 
- `approve-task`: Approve a completed task and transfer the reward
- `get-task`: Retrieve information about a specific task

### Data Structure:

Tasks are stored with the following properties:
- `description`: Task description (string-utf8 256)
- `reward`: STX reward amount (uint)
- `poster`: Address of the task creator (principal)
- `claimer`: Address of the claimer, if claimed (optional principal)
- `status`: Current task status ("open", "claimed", or "completed")

## Using the Testnet dApp

1. Visit your deployed frontend URL
2. Make sure your Hiro Wallet is set to testnet mode:
   - Open Hiro Wallet extension
   - Go to Settings > Network > Select "Testnet"
3. Connect your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button
4. Post tasks:
   - Enter a description
   - Specify the STX reward amount
   - Submit and confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. Claim tasks:
   - Browse available tasks
   - Click "Claim Task" on any task you want to work on

6. Approve tasks:
   - For tasks you've posted, click "Approve & Pay" once the claimer has completed the work
   - Confirm the transaction to release the funds to the claimer

All transactions will be visible in the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co/?chain=testnet) on testnet.
